This repository has the facilitator information for the **high conflict school** simulation.

This is a LARPS (live action roleplay simulation) game which raises awareness
on family issues / socioeconomic inequality and trains negotiation and communication.

The game was constructed and written during
[Act To Understand It](https://waysforyouth.dk/event/52836/)
as a part of the `ERASMUS+ X WaysForYouth X SferaSerbia` training seminar.

## short-summary
Participants are divided into five groups representing the following five families:
* working class family
* conservative family
* hight income family
* low income family
* newly emigrated family

Each family needs at least one child and at least one parent.
The children attend a high school where a new after school activity is to be launched.

The role of each person is to get to know their family and
to convince their family members to vote for the most sensible activity in their scenario.

There are three possible activities:
* rowing
* debate
* football

The premise of the game is that there will be disagreements inside and between families.

## Speeches

### welcome-speech

> Each family stand up and say which family you are.

Hello students, hello parents, welcome back from the summer holidays!
To those of you who are new to the school I am the school principal.

As you know, the school is adding a new after-school activity.
We have recieved several different activity suggestions from each family.
Considering that you come from different backgrounds,
we imagined there would be different suggestions.

Now I know some of you don't get along because of your differences
but I hope we can have a civil debate and come to common conclusion.
but we will spend this term familiarizing with each others wants and needs.

So without further ado please go home to your families and
briefly talk about your preferences so far (first family meeting).

### Student-Council
Student council is an important part of the school.
We expect all the family children to attend the student council.
At this meeting we'll allow the kids to get familiar with what they each want and why.
The kids will meet here at school.

Meanwhile we invite the parents out to talk about their family values separately.
Please bring a sheet of paper and pen so thay you can write down 10 family values each.

### Family-meeting
> Gather everyone back into the room and talk
We have decided that at the end of the year a vote will be cast.
Families do not have to be in complete agreement.

### Parents Teachers Association
At the parents teachers assosication meeting we invite parents to discuss their wants.
Again the meeting is at the school.

The children have been sent on a field trip at which they
This time students stay at home separately.

Students write 10 reasons why they should do **their** activity
and they should do this in silence.

## Pandemic
Please try to reposition your chairs in a way that you cannot see any other families.
You want your privacy and don't want them see-

Uh-oh! have you read the news?
There's a pandemic ravaging across town and schools closed for a little while.

Please without moving your upper bodies - prepare to have a big giant zoom call.

Each family can talk for a couple minutes what family they are and the most two
most important values.

## Family Meeting
We've decided to cast a vote.
Each family will receive a voting slip in the mail. **CUE**.

## Feeback
At the end of the simulation,
the participants and instructors
gave us (facilitators) feedback on the project:
* parents task is clear
* children task is not so clear
* alliances between families not clear
* which family is which?
* timing is flexible - great!
* pandemic zoom call was difficult to emulate
* focus on one key area: either identity, or negotiation or family values.
